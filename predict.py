# predict.py

# This program will be used to predict the price of a car for a given mileage
# When you launch the program, it should prompt you for a mileage,
# and then give you back the estimated price for that mileage.
# The program will use the following hypothesis to predict the price:
# estimatePrice(mileage) = Î¸0 + (Î¸1 âˆ— mileage)
# Before the run of the training program, theta0 and theta1 will be set to 0.

# The program will be run as follows:
